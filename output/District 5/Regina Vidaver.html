<p>It depends. For commuting to work, I generally bike or ride the bus.
For errands, I generally consolidate my trips with a car.</p>

<h1>Madison Bikes questions</h1>
<div id="complete-green-streets" class="section level2">
<h2>Complete Green Streets:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison recently adopted a Complete Green Streets
policy that prioritizes walking, biking, transit, and green
infrastructure over driving and car parking when it comes to allocating
our public right of way. Are you committed to implementing this policy,
especially when a project requires the removal of car parking or
inconveniencing drivers? </strong></p>
<p>Complete green streets is about making our communities better and
safer for all users, including auto drivers. This is a critical piece in
our planning playbook, and I look forward to seeing it implemented as
street reconstruction projects move forward.</p>
</div>
<div id="vision-zero" class="section level2">
<h2>Vision Zero:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison committed to eliminating all fatalities and
serious injuries from traffic crashes by 2035. Yet in 2022, 14 people
were killed, including 3 people riding bikes, and 74 were seriously
injured. Which roadways and intersections in your district should be
prioritized for safety improvements, and what strategies would you use
to ensure improvements are implemented? </strong></p>
<p>I am almost constantly in contact with Traffic Engineering about
safety improvement options in my district. I have requested 4-way stop
signs along Bluff St, speed humps along several residential streets, and
a pedestrian-controlled walkway across Regent Street at Prospect, since
our neighborhood children are often crossing there to access school bus
stops. The City has a very long list of potential safety improvements,
with a robust assessment system for prioritization. I look forward to
seeing some of these safety improvements move forward in the coming
years.</p>
</div>
<div id="bike-network" class="section level2">
<h2>Bike Network:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison Bikes wants all residents to have access to
a low-stress bike network that makes biking safe and convenient for
people of all ages and abilities, no matter where they live in the city.
Where in your district do you see major gaps in this network and how
would you propose to fix these gaps? </strong></p>
<p>There seems to be a gap in getting from more northern areas of my
district to the SW Commuter Path. As local streets are resurfaced and
reconstructed, there may be opportunities to add new bike lanes. These
needs will be top of mind as I discuss future projects with City
staff.</p>
</div>
<div id="transportation-climate-impact" class="section level2">
<h2>Transportation Climate Impact:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In Madison, about 40% of greenhouse gas emissions
come from transportation. How do you think the city should go about
reducing emissions from that sector over the next 5 years? </strong></p>
<p>It is a multifaceted approach: Adding BRT and the Metro redesign;
purchasing electric vehicles and converting diesel vehicles to
biodiesel; implementing the Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
program; building more housing density where there is existing transit;
requiring electric charging sites in parking structures; implementing
the Complete Green Streets initiative. All of these strategies work
together to reduce emissions.</p>

<h1>Madison is for People questions</h1>
<div id="historic-preservation" class="section level2">
<h2>Historic Preservation:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: There have been conflicts between the priorities of
promoting new housing development and preserving historically
significant buildings and neighborhoods in recent years. What specific
factors would you consider when balancing new development against
preservation, and how much weight would you give to the different
factors? </strong></p>
<p>This is always a difficult question to answer. I believe our City
Preservation Planner gets it right when she says (I’m paraphrasing)
“historic preservation does not mean no change. Historic preservation
can occur in the realm of new development, it just needs to be
purposeful and thoughtful.” We are really blessed in having such a
talented Preservation Planner, who takes a nuanced approach to
preservation and development.</p>
</div>
<div id="housing-affordability" class="section level2">
<h2>Housing Affordability:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The City’s 2022 Housing Snapshot indicated that
more housing was needed at all income levels, including both affordable
housing and market rate housing. What is your plan to ensure housing is
built that is available at all income levels? </strong></p>
<p>Again, this is a really difficult question, as the State has tied our
hands so tightly in not being able to require affordable housing be
factored into new developments. So, I take the “always ask” approach -
every developer that comes to me I ask about affordable rental and
purchase options in what they are planning. That is, of course, not
always successful, because unfortunately the costs of everything from
construction materials to labor is rising. I do think that continuing to
ask the question and relay the importance of affordable housing is
necessary. I’m hopeful that as more units are being built, some of the
naturally occurring affordable housing will stabilize further below
market rate. We do have some City programs designed to assist those
sites, and have to balance other factors in the budget to determine if
we can increase those assistance funds.</p>
</div>
<div id="zoning-reform" class="section level2">
<h2>Zoning Reform:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Municipalities across the country, including
Portland, Minneapolis, and Charlotte have taken steps to reform zoning
by eliminating parking minimums and allowing for small multi-family
buildings by-right throughout the city. Would you support similar
reforms in Madison? Why or why not? </strong></p>
<p>We have already done this, by allowing ADUs by right, and allowing a
duplex plus ADU by right and eliminating parking minimums in the TOD
Overlay zone. However, the market is such that very few ADUs are being
built, as the construction costs are so high.</p>

<h1>Madison Area Bus Advocates questions</h1>
<div id="general-vision" class="section level2">
<h2>General Vision:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: 2023 brings many significant changes for Metro
including the beginning of Bus Rapid Transit implementation, a complete
redesign of the transit network, and policy changes such as
Transportation Demand Management and Transit Oriented Development. Do
you support the current direction of Madison’s transit plans, and what
is your vision for Madison’s transit system in the mid and long term?
</strong></p>
<p>As the questions aptly notes, the coming years will see big changes
for our transportation network. The City needs to take an active
approach to reviewing the impacts of these changes, including reviewing
ridership and demand at least every 6 months, and tracking increases in
density along the TOD corridor over time. We owe it to our residents to
be transparent about the impacts these changes actually have on our
community, and if they work as intended, expand them.</p>
</div>
<div id="sustainable-funding" class="section level2">
<h2>Sustainable Funding:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In the Metro redesign, funding constraints limiting
the budget to 2019 levels required compromises in network coverage,
hours of service, and frequency outside a handful of core routes. What
would you do to establish more sustainable funding to improve Metro’s
quality of service? </strong></p>
<p>This is a very difficult question. We don’t want to raise fares too
much, or it will place a higher burden on riders, and they will then
choose cars over the bus. And we have only so many options for external
funding (State, Federal, Philanthropic), though we will max those out to
the best of our abilities. Ultimately, we have to decide as a City that
this is a shared resource and shared value to our community, and use the
City budget accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility" class="section level2">
<h2>Accessibility:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The Metro network redesign has increased the
distance to the nearest bus stop for some residents. This is a major
concern for bus riders with limited mobility. What measures would you
take to ensure riders with mobility limitations are well-served by our
transit system? What do you think the role of paratransit is in this
regard? </strong></p>
<p>I am hopeful that paratransit will meet the needs of our residents
with more limited mobility. I understand that it is not a perfect
system, and cannot be used for emergent transportation needs. I’m
interested in working with colleagues to identify other options for
helping our residents with limited mobility when they have an emergent
need.</p>
