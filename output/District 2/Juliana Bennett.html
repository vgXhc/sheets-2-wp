<h1>Madison Bikes questions</h1>
<div id="complete-green-streets" class="section level2">
<h2>Complete Green Streets:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison recently adopted a Complete Green Streets
policy that prioritizes walking, biking, transit, and green
infrastructure over driving and car parking when it comes to allocating
our public right of way. Are you committed to implementing this policy,
especially when a project requires the removal of car parking or
inconveniencing drivers? </strong></p>
<p>Yes definitely! I was happy to support Complete Green Streets.
Madison should be a 15 minute city, meaning anyone can get anywhere in
the city within 15 minutes. The Bus Rapid Transit, Metro Network
Redesign, and Vision Zero program all helped improve our transportation.
Still, better is possible and necessary.</p>
<p>In my capacity as alder, I will be supportive of providing additional
bus transportation services to the periphery areas of our community and
late night bus services to get residents home safely at night. I will
also advocate for a downtown location of high speed rail, during the
rail study. A good transportation system cannot be solely reliant on our
bus transportation. Thus, I will be supportive of improving safe
right-of-ways for bikers and pedestrians.Overall, I share the vision of
getting people out of cars. However, we need to create a transportation
system where anyone can bus, bike, or walk efficiently in the city.</p>
</div>
<div id="vision-zero" class="section level2">
<h2>Vision Zero:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison committed to eliminating all fatalities and
serious injuries from traffic crashes by 2035. Yet in 2022, 14 people
were killed, including 3 people riding bikes, and 74 were seriously
injured. Which roadways and intersections in your district should be
prioritized for safety improvements, and what strategies would you use
to ensure improvements are implemented? </strong></p>
<p>Vision Zero is an excellent program, but it is still in its pilot
stage. In the next two years, I would like to see the full
implementation of Vision Zero. Some streets that we should focus on is
East Washington Ave, John Nolen Dr, and Fitch Hatchery Rd. These are all
streets that were identified on the high injury zone map. We should do
is reduce speed limits to 20 mi per hour as laid out in the Twenty is
Plenty program.</p>
</div>
<div id="bike-network" class="section level2">
<h2>Bike Network:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison Bikes wants all residents to have access to
a low-stress bike network that makes biking safe and convenient for
people of all ages and abilities, no matter where they live in the city.
Where in your district do you see major gaps in this network and how
would you propose to fix these gaps? </strong></p>
<p>My district downtown is fairly bike and pedestrian friendly. I
believe that we could add protected bike lanes and reduce driving lanes
on streets such as E Gorham, E Johnson, and E Dayton. We could also
reduce speeding in residential areas such as N Pinckney St and N Carroll
St. We can reduce speeding by reducing driving lanes and the speed
limit.</p>
</div>
<div id="transportation-climate-impact" class="section level2">
<h2>Transportation Climate Impact:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In Madison, about 40% of greenhouse gas emissions
come from transportation. How do you think the city should go about
reducing emissions from that sector over the next 5 years? </strong></p>
<p>I like that Bus Rapid uses electric buses. It is a great start to
ensure that our entire city fleet uses electric vehicles. Beyond our own
vehicles, we need to invest more into our transportation system so that
we get people out of cars and into other modes of transportation. Thus,
we should work to reduce bus fees and increase bike and pedestrian
safety.</p>

<h1>Madison is for People questions</h1>
<div id="historic-preservation" class="section level2">
<h2>Historic Preservation:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: There have been conflicts between the priorities of
promoting new housing development and preserving historically
significant buildings and neighborhoods in recent years. What specific
factors would you consider when balancing new development against
preservation, and how much weight would you give to the different
factors? </strong></p>
<p>Oftentimes, we view historic preservation as binary subjects.
Supporting historic preservation and the city’s need to increase density
and affordable housing don’t have to be mutually exclusive. We can
preserve the history and stories of the past, while building for the
future. I specifically consider the impact of the new development and
the value added versus what is being taken away.</p>
<p>For example, when I first came into office, there was a proposed
development at 619/621 N Lake St, where Plan Commission denied the
development because the homes were historic. The Plan Commission was
then appealed and it came to Common Council. I then toured the homes.
They were quite literally falling down and they could not be
refurbished.S he proposed development was would provide part affordable
and part market level housing. It was evident to me that redevelopment
was the best path forward for my district and the city. For a similar
reason, I recently supported the Transit Oriented Development overlay
even for historic districts. All in all, I think that we can commemorate
teh past and build for the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="housing-affordability" class="section level2">
<h2>Housing Affordability:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The City’s 2022 Housing Snapshot indicated that
more housing was needed at all income levels, including both affordable
housing and market rate housing. What is your plan to ensure housing is
built that is available at all income levels? </strong></p>
<p>Increasing affordable housing is one of my top priorities for the
upcoming term. My plan to increase housing is to identify areas that we
can update our zoning code, provide financial incentives, and streamline
the development process.</p>
<p>Our Madison zoning code needs to be updated to allow for increased
density in underdeveloped areas. I understand there is a fear of
bulldozing over neighborhood character to build new housing. However, I
believe we can find a balance between preserving neighborhood housing,
especially naturally-occurring affordable housing, and building for our
need for increased density. For example, I am currently working with
city staff to create a zoning-type incentive that will allow
developments to receive additional stories (within our current height
limits) if they provide a certain amount of affordable units.</p>
<p>We also need to provide financial resources for providing affordable
housing, like opening up our city TIF policy and increasing our land
banking fund. As alder, I sponsored a TIF policy change that removed
restrictions on using TIF for student housing. I also supported
increasing our land banking fund in the 2022 budget cycle. Over the next
two years, I plan to work with my colleagues and the mayor to open up
our TIF policy and increase our land banking fund.</p>
<p>Lastly, we must continue working on streamlining the development
process. As an Urban Design Commission (UDC) member, I was flabbergasted
by a recent debate where UDC members voted against a new development
that would provide 550 units of workforce housing for arbitrary reasons.
I was the only commissioner that spoke in favor of the development,
because of the benefits it would provide our city. When re-elected, I
will actively seek opportunities to streamline the development process,
specifically for developments that provide affordable.</p>

<div id="zoning-reform" class="section level2">
<h2>Zoning Reform:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Municipalities across the country, including
Portland, Minneapolis, and Charlotte have taken steps to reform zoning
by eliminating parking minimums and allowing for small multi-family
buildings by-right throughout the city. Would you support similar
reforms in Madison? Why or why not? </strong></p>
<p>Yes of course! I have been supportive of such reforms, including
zoning reforms for missing middle housing. In my opinion, the zoning
reforms we have been doing are too modest. We should continue to promote
such zoning reforms.</p>

<h1>Madison Area Bus Advocates questions</h1>
<div id="general-vision" class="section level2">
<h2>General Vision:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: 2023 brings many significant changes for Metro
including the beginning of Bus Rapid Transit implementation, a complete
redesign of the transit network, and policy changes such as
Transportation Demand Management and Transit Oriented Development. Do
you support the current direction of Madison’s transit plans, and what
is your vision for Madison’s transit system in the mid and long term?
</strong></p>
<p>Over the past two years, I have been supportive of BRT, Metro Network
Redesign, Vision Zero, TOD and more that will expand our transportation
system. I am currently the only candidate in the race that supports Bus
Rapid Transit on State St, which is a decision that centers the needs of
bus riders. In the next two years, I intend to continue to be supportive
of a robust transportation system.</p>
<p>Madison has a decent transportation system if you live downtown. Our
transportation becomes difficult to access in the periphery areas of our
city. I believe Madison should be a 15 minute city, meaning anyone can
get anywhere in the city within 15 minutes. The Bus Rapid Transit, Metro
Network Redesign, and Vision Zero program all helped improve our
transportation. Still, better is possible and necessary.</p>
<p>In my capacity as alder, I will be supportive of providing additional
bus transportation services to the periphery areas of our community and
late night bus services to get residents home safely at night. I will
also advocate for a downtown location of high speed rail, during the
rail study. A good transportation system cannot be solely reliant on our
bus transportation. Thus, I will be supportive of improving safe
right-of-ways for bikers and pedestrians. However, we need to create a
transportation system where anyone can bus, bike, or walk efficiently in
the city.</p>
</div>
<div id="sustainable-funding" class="section level2">
<h2>Sustainable Funding:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In the Metro redesign, funding constraints limiting
the budget to 2019 levels required compromises in network coverage,
hours of service, and frequency outside a handful of core routes. What
would you do to establish more sustainable funding to improve Metro’s
quality of service? </strong></p>
<p>We are in a budget deficit, yes. We are also at a point where we need
to get our priorities in order of what we do/do not want to fund. Over
the past few budget cycles, I have also seen how nearly every other
agency has made sacrifices due to our budget crisis, while the current
administration has been able to find money to increase police funding by
$3 million over the past two years. I believe that we need to
re-evaluate our priorities and place transportation to the top.</p>
<p>Given the WI legislature cutting funding for transportation and
Madison in general, we should look at increasing city revenue, through
alternative methods. For example, we can increasing vehicle licensing
and registration fees. We can ensure enforcement of the Transportation
Demand Management program, including fees if the program requirements
aren’t met by developers. We should also continue to seek state and
federal funding for transportation.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility" class="section level2">
<h2>Accessibility:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The Metro network redesign has increased the
distance to the nearest bus stop for some residents. This is a major
concern for bus riders with limited mobility. What measures would you
take to ensure riders with mobility limitations are well-served by our
transit system? What do you think the role of paratransit is in this
regard? </strong></p>
<p>From my time on Council, I have seen how the city is not always good
at including community voices, especially those that are underserved
like riders with limited mobility. I believe a lot of our problems
regarding access would be solved if the city actively engaged
communities most impacted by our transit system.</p>
<p>For example, I spoke with a resident of mine who lives with
disabilities. The resident informed me about how the new Metro lines
planned to use a letter system (ie. Line A, B…M, N…), which makes the
bus line difficult to navigate for people who are hard of hearing and
cannot distinguish phonetically similar route names. So, I went to city
staff and we were able to change the route names to remove any names
that would not be inclusive to our hard of hearing residents. What this
example shows is that this issue of the bus route names being inclusive
would not have been considered if I didn’t hear from a resident. Thus,
we need to proactively seek community input and make accommodations to
our transit system.</p>
<p>Paratransit certainly plays a role in increasing access for community
members with mobility limitations. From my purview, it is also an area
that is overlooked. We should increase awareness and funding for our
Metro paratransit system.</p>
