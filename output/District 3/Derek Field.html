<h1>Madison Bikes questions</h1>
<div id="complete-green-streets" class="section level2">
<h2>Complete Green Streets:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison recently adopted a Complete Green Streets
policy that prioritizes walking, biking, transit, and green
infrastructure over driving and car parking when it comes to allocating
our public right of way. Are you committed to implementing this policy,
especially when a project requires the removal of car parking or
inconveniencing drivers? </strong></p>
<p>Yes. I believe in the objectives of this policy.</p>
</div>
<div id="vision-zero" class="section level2">
<h2>Vision Zero:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison committed to eliminating all fatalities and
serious injuries from traffic crashes by 2035. Yet in 2022, 14 people
were killed, including 3 people riding bikes, and 74 were seriously
injured. Which roadways and intersections in your district should be
prioritized for safety improvements, and what strategies would you use
to ensure improvements are implemented? </strong></p>
<p>Traffic safety is one of the top issues residents raise with me as I
canvass neighborhoods in my district. I applaud previous work done to
bring improvements to District 3, some of which were just approved for
2023, but we still have many spots in the district where the City needs
to do better. I support the points-based and data-driven Safe Streets
system of allocating money for improvement projects based on safety
overall and for bikes and pedestrians and based on social impact. Here
are some specific projects I’d like to see in the future: better
signaling and clearer crosswalks intersection of Acewood Blvd and
Cottage Grove Road, expansions of the Milwaukee Street and Cottage Grove
Road bridges, speed mitigation (like radar speed signs) on Milwaukee
Street, Kurt Drive, Meadowlark, Milky Way Drive, Acewood, clear bike
lanes on Acewood, and more off-street path options for bike riders that
connect over Hwys 30 and 151 to the rest of the city.</p>
</div>
<div id="bike-network" class="section level2">
<h2>Bike Network:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison Bikes wants all residents to have access to
a low-stress bike network that makes biking safe and convenient for
people of all ages and abilities, no matter where they live in the city.
Where in your district do you see major gaps in this network and how
would you propose to fix these gaps? </strong></p>
<p>I see major gaps in the network right in my district. Neighborhoods
on the far east side are rigidly segmented and disconnected from
neighboring parts of the city by massive highways like 151, 30, and
I90/I94. The roadways that cross these corridors carry a lot of traffic
and include huge, complex intersections that don’t feel safe to cross on
foot or ride through on a bike. I support city efforts to
better-integrate neighborhoods in my district with the rest of the city
by offering more and safer ways to cross these major highways, such as
pedestrian and bike bridges over those roads whose placement aligns with
existing or potential bike and mixed use path corridors.</p>

<div id="transportation-climate-impact" class="section level2">
<h2>Transportation Climate Impact:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In Madison, about 40% of greenhouse gas emissions
come from transportation. How do you think the city should go about
reducing emissions from that sector over the next 5 years? </strong></p>
<p>Within transportation, I think Madison should be reducing its
greenhouse gas emissions by offering clear, convenient, and reliable
alternatives to cars and single-rider car trips around the city. To me
that means offering improved transit service as well as adding
safely-marked or barrier-separated bike lanes and signaling to roads and
adding more bike paths that connect to other paths used by bike
riders.</p>

<h1>Madison is for People questions</h1>
<div id="historic-preservation" class="section level2">
<h2>Historic Preservation:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: There have been conflicts between the priorities of
promoting new housing development and preserving historically
significant buildings and neighborhoods in recent years. What specific
factors would you consider when balancing new development against
preservation, and how much weight would you give to the different
factors? </strong></p>
<p>Madison is experiencing a housing crisis. We need to balance
preservation of historically significant sites with the need for more
housing options to meet growing demand. Factors I would consider are:
the number of historical significance standards identified by the
Landmarks Commission applying to a site, neighborhood input/concerns,
the potential number of new housing units to be added and the price
point of those new units outlined in a development proposal, and the
distance to amenities and services that potential residents might use
like employment centers or transit stops. These are all important
factors and the weight I place on each will depend on the strength of
the case for historical significance, the severity of the housing
crisis, and the city’s progress adding housing options at the time.</p>
</div>
<div id="housing-affordability" class="section level2">
<h2>Housing Affordability:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The City’s 2022 Housing Snapshot indicated that
more housing was needed at all income levels, including both affordable
housing and market rate housing. What is your plan to ensure housing is
built that is available at all income levels? </strong></p>
<p>Housing is one of my core campaign issues. My partner and I
experienced Madison’s housing crisis for ourselves when we bought our
home in early 2021: we offered on twelve houses and had to offer more
and more money above asking price before we succeeded on the twelfth
offer. That’s not sustainable. The demand for housing far exceeds
Madison’s supply, driving up housing costs and eroding everybody’s
standard of living - particularly for renters and fixed-income seniors.
I want to work to bring more housing options to Madison including both
market rate and affordable housing. I support reasonable development as
well as creative ways to add more housing at a lower price point such as
well as cohousing, cooperatives, and ADUs, as well as the zoning changes
needed to allow those options to meet our community’s rising demand for
housing.</p>
</div>
<div id="zoning-reform" class="section level2">
<h2>Zoning Reform:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Municipalities across the country, including
Portland, Minneapolis, and Charlotte have taken steps to reform zoning
by eliminating parking minimums and allowing for small multi-family
buildings by-right throughout the city. Would you support similar
reforms in Madison? Why or why not? </strong></p>
<p>I believe that zoning is a policy tool, and that it was implemented
by the community many decades ago in an attempt to freeze Madison in
time - but that’s not how cities work, especially when they’re growing
and desirable places to live like Madison. I would support these reforms
to relax parking minimums overall, and to eliminate them in parts of the
city that are served by high-frequency transit. Parking spaces drive
housing costs higher and those cars contribute to snarls of traffic. I
also do support reforms enabling Accessory Dwelling Units as a way to
add more housing, usually at a lower price point and with less
neighborhood disruption.</p>

<h1>Madison Area Bus Advocates questions</h1>
<div id="general-vision" class="section level2">
<h2>General Vision:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: 2023 brings many significant changes for Metro
including the beginning of Bus Rapid Transit implementation, a complete
redesign of the transit network, and policy changes such as
Transportation Demand Management and Transit Oriented Development. Do
you support the current direction of Madison’s transit plans, and what
is your vision for Madison’s transit system in the mid and long term?
</strong></p>
<p>I’m excited for the areas of the city whose transit service is
improving with higher frequency, including along the D1 and C1 lines in
my district and the BRT along East Wash on the north boundary of my
district. However I’m concerned about the loss of through-neighborhood
service, which I have heard at a few folks’ doors will require them to
walk farther than the used to, to the edge of their neighborhood, to
catch a bus. My vision is for transit to be a convenient and affordable
alternative to cars in Madison that offers viable routes for commutes as
well as trips to services like healthcare appointments and neighborhood
amenities like parks, retail, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="sustainable-funding" class="section level2">
<h2>Sustainable Funding:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In the Metro redesign, funding constraints limiting
the budget to 2019 levels required compromises in network coverage,
hours of service, and frequency outside a handful of core routes. What
would you do to establish more sustainable funding to improve Metro’s
quality of service? </strong></p>
<p>Transit service must be a budget priority going into some tough
upcoming budget years and I’ll remain an advocate for our public
transit. Metro Transit service has to be adequate and convenient enough
for more people to choose to take the bus instead of driving their cars
and occupying housing. I’m interested in ways that the City can
disincentivize cars and parking, especially in parts of the city with
frequent transit service, through parking fees or vehicle registration
fees, to be used on the alternative to cars: supporting Metro Transit
specifically for expanding and improving service.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility" class="section level2">
<h2>Accessibility:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The Metro network redesign has increased the
distance to the nearest bus stop for some residents. This is a major
concern for bus riders with limited mobility. What measures would you
take to ensure riders with mobility limitations are well-served by our
transit system? What do you think the role of paratransit is in this
regard? </strong></p>
<p>This is a concern in my district as well - one that I’ve discussed
with a few residents at their doors while canvassing. We have several
large neighborhoods that currently have through-neighborhood service,
and which are about to lose their through-neighborhood service and
instead need to walk farther. Riders with mobility limitations must be a
core priority for paratransit services. Since these residents likely
chose to live where they do in part because of easy access to transit,
and because the network redesign requires some folks to walk farther
than they currently do, the City needs to be prepared to offer more and
better paratransit for folks with mobility issues whose access to
transit was just made more difficult. Longer-term, I think Metro Transit
needs to consider restoring through-neighborhood transit service for
large neighborhoods whose residents will now have to walk far for
service.</p>
