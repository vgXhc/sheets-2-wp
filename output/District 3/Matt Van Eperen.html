<h2>When was the last time you took the bus?</h2>
<p>The last time I took the bus was before Covid. I’ve never rode in
Madison (we moved here during the pandemic). I work from home 4 days a
week and my wife drops me off on her way to work (in Waunakee area) the
one day I go in. We also only own one vehicle.</p>

<h2>When was the last time you rode your bike to work, to school, or for
an errand?</h2>
<p>The last time I rode my bike to work, school, or for an errand was
likely in high school. Once I went to college, I didn’t need one (I
walked everywhere). However, my wife and I just purchased bikes late
last fall and we’ll be biking with our 1-year-old on back once the
weather warms up.</p>

<p>The primary way I move around the city is…I don’t (I rarely leave the
house if it’s not for a walk). Some kidding aside, the way I move around
the city is with our VW Tiguan.</p>

<h1>Madison Bikes questions</h1>
<div id="complete-green-streets" class="section level2">
<h2>Complete Green Streets:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison recently adopted a Complete Green Streets
policy that prioritizes walking, biking, transit, and green
infrastructure over driving and car parking when it comes to allocating
our public right of way. Are you committed to implementing this policy,
especially when a project requires the removal of car parking or
inconveniencing drivers? </strong></p>
<p>To me, the answer depends on the specific facts and circumstances of
the case. In a general sense, yes, I’d likely be agreeable. However, a
concrete answer would depend on the specific situation. For example, if
we’re eliminating car parking, are there alternative locations nearby or
on-property for those vehicles? Are there a lot of vehicles parked? What
do the folks affected think? There are certainly ways to solve the
issues, but it needs input from folks affected. We also need to push
solutions and alternative options for folks affected before we dig a
hole for them and throw them in it.</p>
</div>
<div id="vision-zero" class="section level2">
<h2>Vision Zero:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison committed to eliminating all fatalities and
serious injuries from traffic crashes by 2035. Yet in 2022, 14 people
were killed, including 3 people riding bikes, and 74 were seriously
injured. Which roadways and intersections in your district should be
prioritized for safety improvements, and what strategies would you use
to ensure improvements are implemented? </strong></p>
<p>Without a doubt, the Milwaukee Street bridge over I-90 is a huge
safety concern, and one I bring up all the time (and which is brought up
to me while out in the community). It’s honestly a bit surprising that
there have not been many serious injuries. The bridge is extremely
narrow (especially during winter months when the snow is plowed) and at
night is very dark. With a lot of folks (usually young) crossing into my
neighborhood of Grandview Commons, I and others are afraid it’s only a
matter of time before there is a fatality. One roadway that has already
gone through improvements, though, is that same Milwaukee Street,
stretching from the west side of the bridge to the end. This vision and
work will be needed as other roadways and intersections are identified,
like the Sprecher Rd./Hwy T interchange by I-94. This has become a lot
busier even since I moved here—there’s one narrow lane each way and no
bike lane or sidewalk. The best strategy to ensure that improvements are
implemented is really just to work hard on getting the word out about
the issues and collaborating with colleagues in city government, county
government, and state government to ensure we have funding allocated to
address safety concerns related to transportation infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div id="bike-network" class="section level2">
<h2>Bike Network:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison Bikes wants all residents to have access to
a low-stress bike network that makes biking safe and convenient for
people of all ages and abilities, no matter where they live in the city.
Where in your district do you see major gaps in this network and how
would you propose to fix these gaps? </strong></p>
<p>Part of District 3 stretches from where Sprecher Rd. turns into
Reiner Rd. after Hwy T and runs up to the Woods Farm subdivision. The
road itself is a one-way each way, which isn’t much of an issue even
though it’s gotten busier. The issue lies in the fact that there is no
room for biking/running/walking, which disconnects folks in that area
from the rest of the city. This is related to the Milwaukee St. bridge,
which has no dedicated safe space for pedestrian or bike use. I would
propose to fix gaps like these by working with folks in city government
and also in county government and state government to try to get some
funding allocated for at least dedicated bike/pedestrian lanes.</p>
</div>
<div id="transportation-climate-impact" class="section level2">
<h2>Transportation Climate Impact:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In Madison, about 40% of greenhouse gas emissions
come from transportation. How do you think the city should go about
reducing emissions from that sector over the next 5 years? </strong></p>
<p>One of the strongest ways that Madison can reduce emissions from the
transportation sector is ensuring that the city’s transit system is
environmentally-friendly and sustainable, and then work to incentivize
using public transit. Having transit that utilizes hybrid-electric buses
and now our new battery-electric buses is a great step forward, and we
need to be mindful of and stay at the forefront of cutting-edge green
transit. With our own fleet working towards sustainability and low
emissions, we should then incentivize folks to use public transit
instead of personal single-trip vehicles. What that looks like would
depend on community input, but certainly includes an examination of free
or significantly-reduced transit passes, as well as transit that
frequently connects folks with where they want and need to go.</p>

<h1>Madison is for People questions</h1>
<div id="historic-preservation" class="section level2">
<h2>Historic Preservation:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: There have been conflicts between the priorities of
promoting new housing development and preserving historically
significant buildings and neighborhoods in recent years. What specific
factors would you consider when balancing new development against
preservation, and how much weight would you give to the different
factors? </strong></p>
<p>I think the landmark ordinance serves a good purpose—it seeks to
preserve the history, culture, and character of a neighborhood.
Preservation of historically-significant buildings and neighborhoods is
not something to just disregard. However, the ordinance is a tool that
has been used to stop housing projects (particularly non-single-family
housing), and it is fairly obvious when that occurs. Yes, we need to
find ways to preserve history, but that cannot come at the expense of
our future. If we inhibit our city’s housing growth, we’ll inhibit our
city’s economic and social growth, and harm our environmental
sustainability as development sprawls. A few factors to consider are
what the historical event was, whether folks in the historical community
and not just the neighborhood community consider the event historical,
whether the event and building are interconnected, and if there are ways
to incorporate the building into the new development. A lot of these
preservation/development conflicts are to be decided on a case-by-case
basis, but at the end of the day, people should be prioritized over
buildings, and that view should factor into our decisions.</p>

<div id="housing-affordability" class="section level2">
<h2>Housing Affordability:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The City’s 2022 Housing Snapshot indicated that
more housing was needed at all income levels, including both affordable
housing and market rate housing. What is your plan to ensure housing is
built that is available at all income levels? </strong></p>
<p>Housing is a major issue, and as Madison continues to grow, we need
to ensure housing is available and affordable, and that folks are not
displaced. There are a number of actions that we can examine: (i) zoning
(which the council has considered at least in part), (ii) building
ordinances (such as eliminating/reducing parking requirements or
stairwells), (iii) approving developments more quickly / expedited
permitting, (iv) expanding the affordable housing trust fund, (v)
inventory/allocate public-owned land for affordable housing or shelter,
(vi) density bonus, which would allow for developers to build more units
in exchange for more affordable units, (vii) providing certain tax
exemptions/abatement, (viii) fully legalizing accessory dwelling units,
and (ix) reducing labor shortages/costs so that housing is built cheaper
and costs aren’t passed on to owners/renters. We also need to be mindful
not to fall in the trap of building only single-family housing or
apartments. For housing to be affordable, there also needs to be
sufficient inventory of all types of housing and housing of different
size. We will also need to collaborate with surrounding municipalities
to all work towards the same goal, since our neighbors are also
experiencing rapid population growth and we cannot solve a housing
crisis alone.</p>
</div>
<div id="zoning-reform" class="section level2">
<h2>Zoning Reform:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Municipalities across the country, including
Portland, Minneapolis, and Charlotte have taken steps to reform zoning
by eliminating parking minimums and allowing for small multi-family
buildings by-right throughout the city. Would you support similar
reforms in Madison? Why or why not? </strong></p>
<p>Yes, I would support zoning reforms. Particularly around high-traffic
transportation corridors, assuming there is quality public
transportation, parking should be less of a need, and the space
previously used for housing can be better served as retail, greenspace,
or housing. As for retail itself, it’s becoming more common to retail
online, and so there’s less of a need for big box stores to have a few
football fields of asphalt. It’s not just zoning parking minimums,
though. We can also examine building codes like how many stairwells are
actually required for a safe apartment/condo complex. If it’s possible
to reduce parking and useless building ordinances to fit more housing
into property sizes, we should favor that. As it relates to allowing for
small multi-family buildings by-right, I think a benefit of by-right
development that is that there is more predictability and certainty
about what kinds of development to expect. Not only would it likely
lower the cost of development, it should also increase the supply of
housing. When development becomes overburdened with discretion, those
discretionary decisions can be weaponized against affordable housing
development and against folks who are seeking affordable housing. Not
all reforms being pushed will be adopted, but it’s important to again
center our decisions on what is best for the broader community and work
towards fair and affordable housing.</p>

<h1>Madison Area Bus Advocates questions</h1>
<div id="general-vision" class="section level2">
<h2>General Vision:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: 2023 brings many significant changes for Metro
including the beginning of Bus Rapid Transit implementation, a complete
redesign of the transit network, and policy changes such as
Transportation Demand Management and Transit Oriented Development. Do
you support the current direction of Madison’s transit plans, and what
is your vision for Madison’s transit system in the mid and long term?
</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I do support the current direction of Madison’s transit plans.
However, I think we need to constantly evaluate the plans and
incorporate necessary changes where we identify inadequate plans or
services. As Madison (and Dane County, in general) continue to grow, we
need to be mindful of where folks are and where folks need/want to go. I
think transit should meet people’s needs and adapt its capabilities,
rather than people adapting their needs and meeting transit’s
capabilities. Transit Oriented Development is a great way for
coordination between efficient land use and public transit. Not only
should it provide quality transit, but it should ensure compact,
mixed-use development that adequately meets folks’ housing, retail, and
service needs. Transportation Demand Management goes hand-in-hand with
TOD, providing folks with more choices and fewer issues. Another thing
to be mindful of is the budget—we need to ensure public transit has
adequate funding. My vision for Madison’s transit system in the short-,
mid-, and long-term is to ensure equitable transit, incentivize
mixed-use development with affordable housing along transit corridors,
promote more frequent/on-time/reliable transit operations, guarantee
equal and equitable access to roads and sidewalks, engage in necessary
street and intersection redesign, and examine possibilities to make
public transit free or significantly reduced, including working with
private business on discounts to bus passes provided to employees.</p>
</div>
<div id="sustainable-funding" class="section level2">
<h2>Sustainable Funding:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In the Metro redesign, funding constraints limiting
the budget to 2019 levels required compromises in network coverage,
hours of service, and frequency outside a handful of core routes. What
would you do to establish more sustainable funding to improve Metro’s
quality of service? </strong></p>
<p>First of all, I think it’s important to note that it was a policy
choice made by the city to limit the budget to 2019 levels, and one that
did not have to be made. However, our elected officials considered the
facts and circumstances and came to that conclusion, so our purpose now
is to ensure Metro’s service is quality and that the funding is
sustainable. We should constantly be seeking federal and state grants
and funding, so that we can equip our transit with the necessary tools
to meet the demand and needs of the community. We can also seek funding
from large philanthropies and foundations. At the end of the day,
though, if we don’t receive funding from outside agencies or
organizations, transit funding comes down to our budget, and our duty is
to prioritize people, ensuring that the way transit operates does not
create or expand disparities among folks, nor make transportation more
difficult.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility" class="section level2">
<h2>Accessibility:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The Metro network redesign has increased the
distance to the nearest bus stop for some residents. This is a major
concern for bus riders with limited mobility. What measures would you
take to ensure riders with mobility limitations are well-served by our
transit system? What do you think the role of paratransit is in this
regard? </strong></p>
<p>Increased distance to the nearest bus stops due to the network
redesign is concerning, but so is the assumption that we can rely on
paratransit—paratransit is expensive. As the city strives for transit
equity, it cannot forget that accessibility includes disabled folks who
are harmed by increased distances to transit. I think it’s much easier
to accept decreased amount of stops along transit corridors that are
pedestrian-oriented, because it will be easier to use those areas than
in deep single-family neighborhoods (particularly in winter when there’s
a lot of snow and folks aren’t constantly shoveling). Paratransit should
always remain an option, but due to its expense, it would (or at least
should) be easier to guarantee access to the current transit system.
City government needs to hear from folks affected by these issues and
incorporate the suggestions into transit plans.</p>
