<h1>Madison Bikes questions</h1>
<div id="complete-green-streets" class="section level2">
<h2>Complete Green Streets:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison recently adopted a Complete Green Streets
policy that prioritizes walking, biking, transit, and green
infrastructure over driving and car parking when it comes to allocating
our public right of way. Are you committed to implementing this policy,
especially when a project requires the removal of car parking or
inconveniencing drivers? </strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. It’s far too easy to find free or cheap parking for
single occupancy vehicles. I lived on the capitol square for over a
decade and still visit downtown. The deck is stacked too far towards car
drivers.</p>
<p>There is plenty of space in district 12 for vehicles to park and
ride. This would reduce traffic and the need for parking on the cramped
isthmus.</p>
</div>
<div id="vision-zero" class="section level2">
<h2>Vision Zero:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison committed to eliminating all fatalities and
serious injuries from traffic crashes by 2035. Yet in 2022, 14 people
were killed, including 3 people riding bikes, and 74 were seriously
injured. Which roadways and intersections in your district should be
prioritized for safety improvements, and what strategies would you use
to ensure improvements are implemented? </strong></p>
<p>I’ve spoken with potential constituents in the Hawthorne and Sherman
neighborhoods and would eliminate some of the uncontrolled intersections
there.</p>
<p>I would work with MPD to focus more enforcement on Packers Ave, where
drivers routinely go 55 in the 35 mph zone. I myself either cross or
merge onto Packers from 6th Street every day</p>
</div>
<div id="bike-network" class="section level2">
<h2>Bike Network:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison Bikes wants all residents to have access to
a low-stress bike network that makes biking safe and convenient for
people of all ages and abilities, no matter where they live in the city.
Where in your district do you see major gaps in this network and how
would you propose to fix these gaps? </strong></p>
<p>I would like to add bike traffic signals to all intersections of
Starkweather Creek Path (and Cap City) in order of bike and pedestrian
traffic. They are successful at first street and S Blount. Removing
uncontrolled intersections increases safety and confidence in the
network.</p>
</div>
<div id="transportation-climate-impact" class="section level2">
<h2>Transportation Climate Impact:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In Madison, about 40% of greenhouse gas emissions
come from transportation. How do you think the city should go about
reducing emissions from that sector over the next 5 years? </strong></p>
<p>Buy the rest of the all electric BRT buses and replace all metro
buses with full electric. Reduce coal dependence by fighting rural
NIMBYS who oppose wind and solar farms. Make smart decisions about
removing green spaces and add them wherever possible. The new BRT
building will have a lot of roof for solar panels and plantings.</p>

<h1>Madison is for People questions</h1>
<div id="historic-preservation" class="section level2">
<h2>Historic Preservation:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: There have been conflicts between the priorities of
promoting new housing development and preserving historically
significant buildings and neighborhoods in recent years. What specific
factors would you consider when balancing new development against
preservation, and how much weight would you give to the different
factors? </strong></p>
<p>I am for historic preservation when it is done in good faith, but
timing is the biggest factor I would consider. I would oppose any
historic preservation that was brought to the council after a
development had been proposed. These bad faith submissions are
weaponizing and ultimately weakening the historic preservation ordinance
and landmarks commission.</p>
<p>Historic standards need to be analyzed independently so the public
can offer legitimate input outside of their opposition to specific
development proposals</p>
</div>
<div id="housing-affordability" class="section level2">
<h2>Housing Affordability:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The City’s 2022 Housing Snapshot indicated that
more housing was needed at all income levels, including both affordable
housing and market rate housing. What is your plan to ensure housing is
built that is available at all income levels? </strong></p>
<p>Focus on the extremes. The most recent housing data shows the largest
deficits are for high end housing and for affordable housing for those
making less than 30% AMI. I would increase the city’s affordable housing
fund and narrow the focus to developments that include minimum numbers
of units for the poorest renters. I would push for true high end housing
and not lipstick on pig “luxury” units. There are many high earners that
want actual quality apartments and are willing to pay. Then the process
of filtering can begin, increasing housing options for everyone
else.</p>
</div>
<div id="zoning-reform" class="section level2">
<h2>Zoning Reform:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Municipalities across the country, including
Portland, Minneapolis, and Charlotte have taken steps to reform zoning
by eliminating parking minimums and allowing for small multi-family
buildings by-right throughout the city. Would you support similar
reforms in Madison? Why or why not? </strong></p>
<p>I support all upzoning and removal of parking minimums, especially in
the identified TOD overly districts. Higher density and more units
improve housing options, lower rents and property taxes, and increase
available funds for all city programs.</p>
</div>

<div id="madison-area-bus-advocates-questions" class="section level1">
<h1>Madison Area Bus Advocates questions</h1>
<div id="general-vision" class="section level2">
<h2>General Vision:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: 2023 brings many significant changes for Metro
including the beginning of Bus Rapid Transit implementation, a complete
redesign of the transit network, and policy changes such as
Transportation Demand Management and Transit Oriented Development. Do
you support the current direction of Madison’s transit plans, and what
is your vision for Madison’s transit system in the mid and long term?
</strong></p>
<p>Yes I fully support BRT and the metro redesign, and would push for
expansion of BRT to include a north/south route.</p>
<p>I strongly support TOD zoning changes and upzoning of all kinds. This
helps create ridership that will allow future expansion of bus services
in Madison.</p>
</div>
<div id="sustainable-funding" class="section level2">
<h2>Sustainable Funding:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In the Metro redesign, funding constraints limiting
the budget to 2019 levels required compromises in network coverage,
hours of service, and frequency outside a handful of core routes. What
would you do to establish more sustainable funding to improve Metro’s
quality of service? </strong></p>
<p>All city services depend on tax dollars. Allowing more higher density
development increase the city’s tax base so fewer compromises will need
to be made. It will also reduce the need for borrowing. Money spent on
debt service is money not spent on other city services.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility" class="section level2">
<h2>Accessibility:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The Metro network redesign has increased the
distance to the nearest bus stop for some residents. This is a major
concern for bus riders with limited mobility. What measures would you
take to ensure riders with mobility limitations are well-served by our
transit system? What do you think the role of paratransit is in this
regard? </strong></p>
<p>I believe that longer distances were a compromise that was needed to
improve overall bus service. Those unable to make it to a bus stop have
options, especially those eligible for paratransit services like group
access.</p>
