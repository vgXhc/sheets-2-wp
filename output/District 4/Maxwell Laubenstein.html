<h2>When was the last time you took the bus?</h2>
<p>Today is 2/7. I last took the bus on 2/6 and nearly daily before
that.</p>

<h2>When was the last time you rode your bike to work, to school, or for
an errand?</h2>
<p>My bike was recently locked with another lock, had its seat stolen,
and had a tire slashed so unfortunately I have not been biking as often
as I used to while I wait for this repair but I am usually an avid biker
in Madison.</p>

<h1>Madison Bikes questions</h1>
<div id="complete-green-streets" class="section level2">
<h2>Complete Green Streets:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison recently adopted a Complete Green Streets
policy that prioritizes walking, biking, transit, and green
infrastructure over driving and car parking when it comes to allocating
our public right of way. Are you committed to implementing this policy,
especially when a project requires the removal of car parking or
inconveniencing drivers? </strong></p>
<p>I came to UW-Madison to study to eventually work in the field of
ecological restoration. I am an environmentalist at heart. As said
earlier, with the growing city, supporting residents and communities
doesn’t come from supporting cars. If the city can ensure accessible and
quality public transit, the loss of parking lots should not be a
concern.</p>
</div>
<div id="vision-zero" class="section level2">
<h2>Vision Zero:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison committed to eliminating all fatalities and
serious injuries from traffic crashes by 2035. Yet in 2022, 14 people
were killed, including 3 people riding bikes, and 74 were seriously
injured. Which roadways and intersections in your district should be
prioritized for safety improvements, and what strategies would you use
to ensure improvements are implemented? </strong></p>
<p>I am very happy to have seen the city implement flashing yields along
intersections on johnson that for months have terrified myself and other
nearby residents. My next priority for safety would be regent and park
streets which can be dangerous for bikers and as such have been
intentionally avoided by many bikers.</p>
</div>
<div id="bike-network" class="section level2">
<h2>Bike Network:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison Bikes wants all residents to have access to
a low-stress bike network that makes biking safe and convenient for
people of all ages and abilities, no matter where they live in the city.
Where in your district do you see major gaps in this network and how
would you propose to fix these gaps? </strong></p>
<p>The route along regent, connecting east and west madison without
going up to university is not easily accessible for bikes and can be
incredibly stressful. I would also like to emphasize that a focus on
bike route expansion is amazing but since biking is not a feasible means
of transportation for many, the expansion of accessible public transit
is just as important.</p>
</div>
<div id="transportation-climate-impact" class="section level2">
<h2>Transportation Climate Impact:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In Madison, about 40% of greenhouse gas emissions
come from transportation. How do you think the city should go about
reducing emissions from that sector over the next 5 years? </strong></p>
<p>School buses are often described as ideal targets for conversion to
electric vehicles due to the limited route and defined charging times
but simply converting to electric options is not the answer. Expanding
public transit will start to reduce the need for personal vehicles and
identifying specific routes to convert to connected electric would
significantly reduce city emissions.</p>

<h1>Madison is for People questions</h1>
<div id="historic-preservation" class="section level2">
<h2>Historic Preservation:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: There have been conflicts between the priorities of
promoting new housing development and preserving historically
significant buildings and neighborhoods in recent years. What specific
factors would you consider when balancing new development against
preservation, and how much weight would you give to the different
factors? </strong></p>
<p>Preserving historic value is valuable until the day it leaves people
unhoused. Even in development, there are routes not currently being
pursued by new developments to ensure the historic style and feature of
some developments can be preserved or utilized even when new
developments are needed.</p>
</div>
<div id="housing-affordability" class="section level2">
<h2>Housing Affordability:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The City’s 2022 Housing Snapshot indicated that
more housing was needed at all income levels, including both affordable
housing and market rate housing. What is your plan to ensure housing is
built that is available at all income levels? </strong></p>
<p>Housing is a mess in madison. The label of affordable housing has
started to loose meaning as rates with this label can still be
financially inaccessible to many madison residents. The city needs to
focus on the reduction of price per square foot to rent in Madison and
hold landlords accountable to ensuring that currently affordable housing
in Madison is maintained to ensure a quality living environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="zoning-reform" class="section level2">
<h2>Zoning Reform:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Municipalities across the country, including
Portland, Minneapolis, and Charlotte have taken steps to reform zoning
by eliminating parking minimums and allowing for small multi-family
buildings by-right throughout the city. Would you support similar
reforms in Madison? Why or why not? </strong></p>
<p>As the city expands, we can either focus on car access and
feasibility, or supporting people through accessible public transit and
zoning for housing instead of mass parking. If this is the ideal
described, I would support it fully.</p>

<div id="madison-area-bus-advocates-questions" class="section level1">
<h1>Madison Area Bus Advocates questions</h1>
<div id="general-vision" class="section level2">
<h2>General Vision:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: 2023 brings many significant changes for Metro
including the beginning of Bus Rapid Transit implementation, a complete
redesign of the transit network, and policy changes such as
Transportation Demand Management and Transit Oriented Development. Do
you support the current direction of Madison’s transit plans, and what
is your vision for Madison’s transit system in the mid and long term?
</strong></p>
<p>I support the idea of the expansion of Madison transit which is
generally being pushed by the city but there are several communities,
neighborhoods, and business centers that are being left disconnected
from each other and limiting access for residents to reach commercial
spaces and city resources.</p>
</div>
<div id="sustainable-funding" class="section level2">
<h2>Sustainable Funding:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In the Metro redesign, funding constraints limiting
the budget to 2019 levels required compromises in network coverage,
hours of service, and frequency outside a handful of core routes. What
would you do to establish more sustainable funding to improve Metro’s
quality of service? </strong></p>
<p>The metro system should be considered a city resource and not a
business. As such, I would support direct funding routes from the city’s
internal budget as opposed to increasing fares. I would work with city
staff and more knowledgeable parties to develop a more stable internal
funding system.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility" class="section level2">
<h2>Accessibility:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The Metro network redesign has increased the
distance to the nearest bus stop for some residents. This is a major
concern for bus riders with limited mobility. What measures would you
take to ensure riders with mobility limitations are well-served by our
transit system? What do you think the role of paratransit is in this
regard? </strong></p>
<p>The paratransit system is a useful service for many but should not be
relied upon to accommodate the primary transit system reducing access
for many. An expansion of routes will continue to be critical as the
city grows and a focus on meeting the needs based on the means of our
varied residents will be critical.</p>
