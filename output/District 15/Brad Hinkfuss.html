<h2>What is the primary way you move around the city?</h2>
<p>For work, I move around by car. This is mostly the result of managing
33 properties of supportive housing that are scattered around the city.
In the past - and for other employers - there were many years where I
biked year-round. For personal transport outside of work, I frequently
move around by bike.</p>

<h1>Madison Bikes questions</h1>
<div id="complete-green-streets" class="section level2">
<h2>Complete Green Streets:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison recently adopted a Complete Green Streets
policy that prioritizes walking, biking, transit, and green
infrastructure over driving and car parking when it comes to allocating
our public right of way. Are you committed to implementing this policy,
especially when a project requires the removal of car parking or
inconveniencing drivers? </strong></p>
<p>Yes, I am committed and excited about the Complete Green Streets
initiative. This represents a bold transformation of the way we think
about our public right of way and how we move through those spaces. When
fully realized, I think that people will truly appreciate the benefits
implicit in this approach since they directly address some of the
environmental and safety concerns that many people have shared with me
while knocking doors and participating in interviews. In all honesty, I
also recognize the challenges involved in implementing this policy.
There will be some resistance to these changes. My job as an elected
leader will be to listen to all the interests involved and not unduly
discredit or ignore some peoples’ concerns. It will be important to look
at the particulars of each situation. There are times when a significant
reduction in road space makes sense - such as the rework of Atwood Ave
that will start in early 2023. There are other times when the automatic
reduction of parking might create a major hardship for a business
district or neighborhood. These decisions should be made through the
lens of Complete Green Streets, but also in consideration of local
variables and interests. Compromise is often the best way to not leave
anyone behind.</p>

<div id="vision-zero" class="section level2">
<h2>Vision Zero:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison committed to eliminating all fatalities and
serious injuries from traffic crashes by 2035. Yet in 2022, 14 people
were killed, including 3 people riding bikes, and 74 were seriously
injured. Which roadways and intersections in your district should be
prioritized for safety improvements, and what strategies would you use
to ensure improvements are implemented? </strong></p>
<p>My priority roadways and intersections include the following, not
necessarily in this order: 1) The intersection of Buckeye Rd and S
Stoughton Rd, which has the awful listing for the most intersection
crashes in the city. 2) Similar to 1, above, the intersection of Pflaum
and S Stoughton Rd. 3) The intersection of Cottage Grove Rd and Monona
Drive 4) The intersection of N Fair Oaks Ave and Milwaukee St. 5) The
intersection of E Washington Ave and North St/Milwaukee St. The City of
Madison has the data that shows us where the danger occurs. The best
time to rework an intersection is during its reconstruction, when the
Transportation Engineering Department can be engaged in a more
comprehensive redesign that prioritizes safety based on the history of
injuries and crashes. If reconstruction is not immediately in the
future, then a wider range of meaningful interventions must be
considered. This can include everything from traffic calming features,
to stronger enforcement, to the addition of separated facilities.</p>
</div>
<div id="bike-network" class="section level2">
<h2>Bike Network:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison Bikes wants all residents to have access to
a low-stress bike network that makes biking safe and convenient for
people of all ages and abilities, no matter where they live in the city.
Where in your district do you see major gaps in this network and how
would you propose to fix these gaps? </strong></p>
<p>One of the major gaps that I see in D15 is the lack of good
connectivity between the southern part of the district, the Glendale and
Lake Edge Neighborhoods, and the better dedicated paths in the
Eastmorland and SASY areas. The addition of dedicated lanes to Monona
Drive was a good start, but that link is still incomplete. Even when
it’s done, many bikers will be afraid to ride on such a busy street.
Better linkages through the neighborhoods should be part of the
solution, as well as an exploration of ways to make the Monona Drive
route more viable (including during winter, for example). Another gap or
series of gaps exist in that there are few safe ways for bikers to cross
S Stoughton Rd. The crossings that do exist occur at the very
intersections that are the most dangerous in the city. These gaps exist
on the eastern edge of D15 and not wholly in the district, so a
collaborative approach will need to be taken with adjacent districts.
Additionally, since this is a US Highway that carries both regional and
local traffic, it may be eligible for more funding to address the
shortcomings. Note that an earlier study and the associated improvements
were delayed in 2017 due to shifting state budget priorities. Lobbying
at the state level to elevate this work is in order.</p>

<div id="transportation-climate-impact" class="section level2">
<h2>Transportation Climate Impact:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In Madison, about 40% of greenhouse gas emissions
come from transportation. How do you think the city should go about
reducing emissions from that sector over the next 5 years? </strong></p>
<p>Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from transportation can only
realistically come from a series of measure that address different
pieces of the problem. The city has started down this path to some
extent, but must maintain this commitment. The following steps will help
achieve this goal: 1) Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) - In order to reduce
single user vehicle trips, people must have a fast and efficient
alternative. The BRT system is one such step, and potentially a very
significant one. 2) Prioritizing the conversion of vehicles (including
buses) from gas to electric, along with the associated infrastructure
needed to support those vehicles. 3) The Transportation Demand
Management (TDM) plan to reduce overall reliance on single user
automotive trips. 4) Complete bike network gaps to make bike
transportation a more obviously viable and safe alternative for the
uninitiated. 5) Emphasize Madison’s support for a passenger rail
connection to Milwaukee, which could supplant a great number of
automotive vehicles and trips every day. 6) Introduce surcharges for
ownership of vehicles in excess of 1 that are registered within the
city. 7) Redirect funding that would go to road expansion, and direct it
instead to alternative forms of transportation and the associated
routes. This can get difficult given the prerogatives of state and
federal funds, but ultimately the reality that we create will reflect
our prioritization of resources. That is how we got to the current
situation of high emissions and greenhouse gases. Only a realignment of
priorities and resources can change it.</p>

<h1>Madison is for People questions</h1>
<div id="historic-preservation" class="section level2">
<h2>Historic Preservation:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: There have been conflicts between the priorities of
promoting new housing development and preserving historically
significant buildings and neighborhoods in recent years. What specific
factors would you consider when balancing new development against
preservation, and how much weight would you give to the different
factors? </strong></p>
<p>The conflict between new development and historic preservation is a
conversation that we should always embrace. The interplay should not be
dictated by hard and fast rules because by fostering meaningful
conversation about proposed changes, room may often be found for
compromise. For example, integrating portions of historic structures
into new buildings, or building new projects in ways that are
architecturally sympathetic to historic styles. Setting the stage for a
meaningful dialogue is the best way to make it happen. Another measure
may embrace an index of change; that is, a given proposal for
redevelopment would be assigned some measure of positive or negative
weight depending on how much similar change has happened within a given
radius within a certain number of years. This recognizes that change is
inevitable to some degree, but that we can intentionally set the pace at
which we encourage or disallow it to happen.</p>
</div>
<div id="housing-affordability" class="section level2">
<h2>Housing Affordability:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The City’s 2022 Housing Snapshot indicated that
more housing was needed at all income levels, including both affordable
housing and market rate housing. What is your plan to ensure housing is
built that is available at all income levels? </strong></p>
<p>They city’s primary investment focus must be at more affordable rates
of housing. The luxury and market rates segments of the market are
largely taking care of themselves under current market pressures. Where
developers are not building things in sufficient quantity are the
segments of housing for people who simply make below market rate
incomes. Many service sector positions, for example, will never pay a
median level income in a community with the high median income of
Madison. Meanwhile, developers are not building much that would be
affordable to anyone making a less than median income. City policy must
intervene and support this type of housing more directly or an
increasingly large number of people with even marginally lower incomes
will have a harder and harder time finding housing that they can
afford.</p>

<div id="zoning-reform" class="section level2">
<h2>Zoning Reform:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Municipalities across the country, including
Portland, Minneapolis, and Charlotte have taken steps to reform zoning
by eliminating parking minimums and allowing for small multi-family
buildings by-right throughout the city. Would you support similar
reforms in Madison? Why or why not? </strong></p>
<p>Yes, I feel that changes to zoning are one place that density and
greater variety can be introduced across the city. The key is to
implement such changes gradually so as to not allow the wholesale
aggregation, razing, and redevelopment of established neighborhoods.
Rather, changes should be introduced to allow incremental change so that
the scale and rate of change does not happen too quickly. People almost
inevitably find any quick change to be disconcerting.</p>

<h1>Madison Area Bus Advocates questions</h1>
<div id="general-vision" class="section level2">
<h2>General Vision:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: 2023 brings many significant changes for Metro
including the beginning of Bus Rapid Transit implementation, a complete
redesign of the transit network, and policy changes such as
Transportation Demand Management and Transit Oriented Development. Do
you support the current direction of Madison’s transit plans, and what
is your vision for Madison’s transit system in the mid and long term?
</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I very much support the prerogatives of TOD and TDM. Madison
needs this recalibration of our management and means of transportation.
The current sense of normal that prioritizes individual auto trips for
the majority of peoples’ transportation needs is completely
unsustainable. I feel that TOD and TDM are the first meaningful steps to
invest in the infrastructure and the planning needed to prioritize
alternatives. My vision for Madison’s transit system is one in which
there are multiple viable alternatives to move safely and efficiently
throughout the city. This means meaningful investments in those options.
The fast and efficient service envisioned with the BRT system is an
excellent example, though the initial iteration of that system will
reduce the depth of service to many neighborhoods. A fully built-out
bike system is another example, where safe and dedicated paths and lanes
create clear connections to all areas of the city. With a transit system
that sees meaningful prioritization of alternatives, people will feel
empowered to make different decisions about how they move through the
city.</p>
</div>
<div id="sustainable-funding" class="section level2">
<h2>Sustainable Funding:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In the Metro redesign, funding constraints limiting
the budget to 2019 levels required compromises in network coverage,
hours of service, and frequency outside a handful of core routes. What
would you do to establish more sustainable funding to improve Metro’s
quality of service? </strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, sustainable funding for an excellent quality of service
will be the product of several things. One will be increasing ridership
so that user fees help support the system. Another would be to explore
road use impact fees for heavier users of the road system. The converse
or impact fees could be the exploration of incentives for the use of
alternatives, such as partnerships with employers. An expansive search
of state and federal funding sources must also be part of this approach
since such sources are very typically a big part of public transit
systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility" class="section level2">
<h2>Accessibility:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The Metro network redesign has increased the
distance to the nearest bus stop for some residents. This is a major
concern for bus riders with limited mobility. What measures would you
take to ensure riders with mobility limitations are well-served by our
transit system? What do you think the role of paratransit is in this
regard? </strong></p>
<p>There must be a parallel paratransit system to work in conjunction
with the redesigned transit system. The needs for paratransit must be
forecast in consideration of the redesigned Metro system. Some
trade-offs will likely be required initially. A place to start may be
reduced frequency of service. While less frequent service is a hardship,
it is not as much of a hardship as no service whatsoever.</p>
