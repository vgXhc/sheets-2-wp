<h2>When was the last time you took the bus?</h2>
<p>In Madison, it has unfortunately been a couple years for me. My wife
takes the bus frequently to get from our house to the university and
hospital areas, but the way our transit system is set up, it isn’t a
viable option for me to get to work in Verona. I would love to expand
the scope and frequency of our neighborhood routes so that we can get
folks onto our major routes more easily.</p>

<h1>Madison Bikes questions</h1>
<div id="complete-green-streets" class="section level2">
<h2>Complete Green Streets:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison recently adopted a Complete Green Streets
policy that prioritizes walking, biking, transit, and green
infrastructure over driving and car parking when it comes to allocating
our public right of way. Are you committed to implementing this policy,
especially when a project requires the removal of car parking or
inconveniencing drivers? </strong></p>
<p>Yes. Our infrastructure has long assumed travel by car as the
dominant (and sometimes only) mode of transportation for residents. We
subsidize parking for cars, design our roads to accommodate behemoths of
vehicles which have no conceivable use for day-to-day drivers, and
generally shunt pedestrians and bikers to the margins of our public
spaces. This has a devastating impact on the environment (since private
vehicles are a chief contributor to our city’s carbon footprint) and on
our local communities, which are often relegated to be nothing more than
throughways for commuters. In my neighborhood, the car-centric designs
of Moorland and Engelhart Rd have some families too afraid to let their
children play outside, walk to the park, or even wait for the school
bus. A more pedestrian-oriented design would encourage better use of our
space, stronger bonds between neighbors, and a more healthy and happy
community. I will seek to complete our transition to green streets,
designating more spaces to be open only to local traffic or completely
inaccessible to cars. I will also make sure the comfort and safety of
those who travel on foot or bike is front of mind for any new street
design.</p>

<div id="vision-zero" class="section level2">
<h2>Vision Zero:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison committed to eliminating all fatalities and
serious injuries from traffic crashes by 2035. Yet in 2022, 14 people
were killed, including 3 people riding bikes, and 74 were seriously
injured. Which roadways and intersections in your district should be
prioritized for safety improvements, and what strategies would you use
to ensure improvements are implemented? </strong></p>
<p>As I said above, Moorland and Engelhart are prime examples of
roadways which are simply too dangerous for bikers and pedestrians as
they are currently constructed. Speed limits have been lowered on both
of these roads, but reckless driving persists. Part of this is due to
those who simply don’t care about speed limits, but another component is
that speed limits can only do so much good if the roads themselves
encourage drivers to go far faster than they should. Streets like these
with wide lanes, limited sidewalks and bike lanes, and no speedbumps or
stop signs subconsciously signal to drivers that they aren’t residential
streets but busy thoroughfares. It doesn’t matter what the speed limit
sign says - If everything your eyes are seeing make you think you have
the whole road to yourself, you’re going to drive faster. Our next phase
of this project needs to involve more physical design changes - More
stop signs, continuous raised crosswalks, protected bike lanes, smaller
lanes for cars, and other infrastructure changes that will force cars to
slow down on these roads. No one should lose a loved one to a traffic
incident that could have been completely avoided through these small
changes.</p>
</div>
<div id="bike-network" class="section level2">
<h2>Bike Network:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison Bikes wants all residents to have access to
a low-stress bike network that makes biking safe and convenient for
people of all ages and abilities, no matter where they live in the city.
Where in your district do you see major gaps in this network and how
would you propose to fix these gaps? </strong></p>
<p>South Park St is probably the most notable area in need of bike
infrastructure improvements in District 14. While the shoulders are
wide, there is not a dedicated bike lane for most of the street, meaning
cyclists have to weave in and out traffic when cars are parked in the
shoulder (as they often are). There are also some dangerous
intersections where right turning traffic has to cross over the bike
lane/shoulder to make their turn (Fish Hatchery-Park is a big one when
going south because cars turning onto Fish Hatchery basically collide
with any bikers going straight). Most drivers are not looking for
cyclists when they move into these lanes and do their right turns, which
leads to more incidents and close calls. Dedicated, protected, and
highly visible bike lanes down the entirety of S Park St would resolve a
lot of these concerns and open the corridor up to more than just cars. I
would also like to see more protection and signage on the Capital City
Trail where it intersects with roads, since cars are not always as
attentive as they should be when bikes are crossing.</p>
</div>
<div id="transportation-climate-impact" class="section level2">
<h2>Transportation Climate Impact:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In Madison, about 40% of greenhouse gas emissions
come from transportation. How do you think the city should go about
reducing emissions from that sector over the next 5 years? </strong></p>
<p>The simplest answer is that we just have to take cars off of the road
any way we can. The more commuters we can get into BRT or e-bikes as
opposed to private cars, the more we will reduce our carbon footprint as
a community. I think all of the changes outlined above will make those
more convenient modes of transportation, and will help move us towards a
greener future. I also think that we can reduce transportation emissions
through smarter design of our neighborhoods. There are definitely some
walkable areas of town near the university or capital square, but too
many of our outlying neighborhoods (such as mine) have no restaurants,
grocery stores, or other essential businesses within walking distance
(or do not have the sidewalks necessary to make it a safe journey). We
should be building fully mixed-use neighborhoods, where residential and
retail are within walking distance of each other, so that folks can get
everything they need without hopping in a car. This would also build a
greater sense of community in our neighborhoods, and provide more
opportunities for new small businesses.</p>

<h1>Madison is for People questions</h1>
<div id="historic-preservation" class="section level2">
<h2>Historic Preservation:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: There have been conflicts between the priorities of
promoting new housing development and preserving historically
significant buildings and neighborhoods in recent years. What specific
factors would you consider when balancing new development against
preservation, and how much weight would you give to the different
factors? </strong></p>
<p>I will always prioritize new high-density housing, especially
affordable housing, in these types of discussion. While we do not want
to erase history or the entire character of a neighborhood, the fact
remains that many of these petitions to preserve “historically
significant” buildings have been bad faith moves by NIMBYs to prevent
new housing development by any means possible. Ideally, new housing
development would be mindful of the history and character of their
neighborhoods, trying to match the aesthetics of surrounding buildings
or paying homage to what came before. I would also give extra
consideration to petitions to preserve locations significant to the
marginalized communities in our city. But the top priority always has to
be addressing the dire lack of housing in Madison, and that will always
be the chief concern in my mind.</p>
</div>
<div id="housing-affordability" class="section level2">
<h2>Housing Affordability:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The City’s 2022 Housing Snapshot indicated that
more housing was needed at all income levels, including both affordable
housing and market rate housing. What is your plan to ensure housing is
built that is available at all income levels? </strong></p>
<p>First off, I will pursue zoning changes that allow for widespread
development of multifamily housing throughout the entire city. Increased
supply will drive down prices across the board and requires less direct
financial support from the city than other policies. I will also work to
make sure funding and incentives for below market rate housing is
preserved in our budget, even with the upcoming shortfalls. Lastly, I
will work with nonprofit developers to reduce the number of hurdles for
them to build new affordable housing projects. But a fight for
affordable, quality housing is not just relegated to new development. As
a member of the Landlord Tenants Issue Committee, I’ve seen the
challenges low-income renters have in finding not only affordable
housing, but affordable housing that delivers acceptable living
conditions. Our city is plagued with profit-driven landlords who do not
live in this city, are not responsive to tenants’ needs, and jack up
rent prices to an absurd degree. I support the current city initiatives
to build more affordable housing, but I also acknowledge that our
current plans do not do enough to tackle this problem quickly.
Unfortunately, preemptive laws from the Republicans in the legislature
tie our hands from taking the most drastic and effective measures as a
city - we cannot limit rent increases, we cannot sanction landlords for
bad behavior except in the most egregious of circumstances, we can’t
even ask for more data on their occupancy rates and prices. However, the
power that has been stripped from the council has not been stripped from
the people. A core plank of my platform is having the city help renters
organize a tenants union, which can use the collective power of tenants
to demand more affordable rents and better living conditions. While the
city cannot actively run this union, it can provide resources,
connections, and publicity to an organization, kickstarting the process
and helping deliver results for all renters.</p>
</div>
<div id="zoning-reform" class="section level2">
<h2>Zoning Reform:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Municipalities across the country, including
Portland, Minneapolis, and Charlotte have taken steps to reform zoning
by eliminating parking minimums and allowing for small multi-family
buildings by-right throughout the city. Would you support similar
reforms in Madison? Why or why not? </strong></p>
<p>Yes. First off, any changes we can make to expedite the development
of multifamily housing is a win in my book. But to these specific
changes, I think that removing parking minimums is a great way to reduce
hurdles for new housing and encourages a less car-dependent
transportation framework in our city. And allowing multifamily housing
to be built by right removes the need to go through additional
permitting processes that slow down development. The crisis with
affordable housing is not some nebulous concern in the far off future
for Madison - It is here now and demands immediate action. I will
consider any policy that speeds up our solution to this problem and
delivers immediate relief to those facing housing insecurity.</p>

<h1>Madison Area Bus Advocates questions</h1>
<div id="general-vision" class="section level2">
<h2>General Vision:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: 2023 brings many significant changes for Metro
including the beginning of Bus Rapid Transit implementation, a complete
redesign of the transit network, and policy changes such as
Transportation Demand Management and Transit Oriented Development. Do
you support the current direction of Madison’s transit plans, and what
is your vision for Madison’s transit system in the mid and long term?
</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I absolutely support the Bus Rapid Transit system and the
Transit Oriented Development zoning changes. Affordable housing is my
number one issue, but expanding public transit is close behind, because
the two issues are so interconnected. In order to have high density,
affordable housing be attainable across the city, we need to make sure
that convenient public transportation is also available throughout the
city. If there is one problem I see with the metro transit redesign,
it’s that we are still not going into neighborhoods with nearly enough
frequency. I would like to cut the time between buses to at least 20
minutes, if not lower, so that transfers between these routes are more
frequent. This will reduce total ride time considerably and make our bus
system a true door-to-door alternative to driving for everyone in the
city.</p>
</div>
<div id="sustainable-funding" class="section level2">
<h2>Sustainable Funding:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In the Metro redesign, funding constraints limiting
the budget to 2019 levels required compromises in network coverage,
hours of service, and frequency outside a handful of core routes. What
would you do to establish more sustainable funding to improve Metro’s
quality of service? </strong></p>
<p>I would reallocate funds from car-centric development projects (such
as new parking decks or widening roads) to our transit system. I would
also look into a more progressive wheel tax for personal vehicles that
charged more based on the value of the vehicle and its environmental
impact (both in terms of emissions and construction) to both close the
funding gap and encourage more ridership.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility" class="section level2">
<h2>Accessibility:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The Metro network redesign has increased the
distance to the nearest bus stop for some residents. This is a major
concern for bus riders with limited mobility. What measures would you
take to ensure riders with mobility limitations are well-served by our
transit system? What do you think the role of paratransit is in this
regard? </strong></p>
<p>In the short term, we need to invest in our pedestrian infrastructure
to make sure that the stops themselves are accessible to those with
limited mobility. Even if your nearest stop is close by, if it is not
accessible through an easy pedestrian path, it won’t do these riders
much good. In the long term, we need to increase the frequency and
number of neighborhood routes so that folks do not have to travel great
distances just to get on the bus. I’d also like to work with County
officials to see if expansions to their OATA program would be a good
interim step in this process.</p>
