<h1>Madison Bikes questions</h1>
<div id="complete-green-streets" class="section level2">
<h2>Complete Green Streets:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison recently adopted a Complete Green Streets
policy that prioritizes walking, biking, transit, and green
infrastructure over driving and car parking when it comes to allocating
our public right of way. Are you committed to implementing this policy,
especially when a project requires the removal of car parking or
inconveniencing drivers? </strong></p>
<p>I am prejudiced about Green Streets. As an avid recreational biker
who bikes to shopping, meetings, seminars, and concerts, when possible,
I love our Madison bike lanes and paths. Despite a rather nasty biking
accident in 2020, I went back out as soon as possible, although I need
to recognize that age and winter ice are not a good mix. My wife and I
chose our home location to maximize our ability to walk to needed
services. Likewise, I prefer to use Metro when the destination is a good
fit. I have studied Green Streets closely, and enthusiastically endorse
the goals and trajectory for development. Let’s maximize the
implementation of Green Streets, using education and logic to, as much
as possible, avoid generating a scale of opposition that halts our
progress.</p>

<div id="vision-zero" class="section level2">
<h2>Vision Zero:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison committed to eliminating all fatalities and
serious injuries from traffic crashes by 2035. Yet in 2022, 14 people
were killed, including 3 people riding bikes, and 74 were seriously
injured. Which roadways and intersections in your district should be
prioritized for safety improvements, and what strategies would you use
to ensure improvements are implemented? </strong></p>
<p>District 19 is relatively safe for biking, although there was a
fatality in an adjoining district on Mineral Point Road. The main
thoroughfares connecting to the isthmus include wide bike/bus lanes on
Mineral Point, Old Sauk, and University, that allow convenient access to
the major separated bike paths. North-south lanes are not quite as safe,
but not scary. Intersections on Mineral Point Road are the most
problematic, but the recent reduction in the speed limit may help. I’ve
studied Vision Zero and support it.</p>
</div>
<div id="bike-network" class="section level2">
<h2>Bike Network:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Madison Bikes wants all residents to have access to
a low-stress bike network that makes biking safe and convenient for
people of all ages and abilities, no matter where they live in the city.
Where in your district do you see major gaps in this network and how
would you propose to fix these gaps? </strong></p>
<p>Overall, as noted above, biking in District 19 is relatively safe and
convenient. Other districts may deserve a higher funding priority. The
one situation that will deserve study is the impact of BRT frequency in
the lanes shared with bikes on Mineral Point Road.</p>
</div>
<div id="transportation-climate-impact" class="section level2">
<h2>Transportation Climate Impact:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In Madison, about 40% of greenhouse gas emissions
come from transportation. How do you think the city should go about
reducing emissions from that sector over the next 5 years? </strong></p>
<p>A key component would seem to be follow-through with Transit Oriented
Development, with it’ emphasis on encouraging the substitution of
walking, biking and public transportation for automobile traffic with
supporting infrastructure and the encouragement of development along
prime public transit corridors. The other important component would be
encouraging the substitution of electric and hybrid vehicles for gas and
diesel vehicles, including busses. That effort probably requires some
attention to the availability of charging infrastructure.</p>

<h1>Madison is for People questions</h1>
<div id="historic-preservation" class="section level2">
<h2>Historic Preservation:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: There have been conflicts between the priorities of
promoting new housing development and preserving historically
significant buildings and neighborhoods in recent years. What specific
factors would you consider when balancing new development against
preservation, and how much weight would you give to the different
factors? </strong></p>
<p>The recent Common Council debate and approval of the TOD Zoning
Overlay (I watched the entire session) and the Landmark designation
application for the Filene building are clear examples of this tension.
I would want to consider (1) the opportunity to develop more affordable
housing, (2) development that advances our approved transportation
plans, and (3) the extent to which a proposed development reduces
historic inequities. Looking at the details of the Hill Farms historic
district, I tend to think that the protections inherent in the
designations will preserve most of the desirable historic features in
the TOD zoning overlay. Part of the Common Council’s obligation is to
educate the electorate on the benefits and sacrifices in proposed
developments, realizing that time-delay tactics are often used to thwart
needed change.</p>
</div>
<div id="housing-affordability" class="section level2">
<h2>Housing Affordability:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The City’s 2022 Housing Snapshot indicated that
more housing was needed at all income levels, including both affordable
housing and market rate housing. What is your plan to ensure housing is
built that is available at all income levels? </strong></p>
<p>I have spent 40 years building housing and other structures in every
conceivable price range and the last 25 years focused on affordable and
sustainable housing - single-family, multi-family, rental,
owner-occupied. In my experience, that I hope to bring to the Council,
there are four factors. First, is technology and building codes,
probably my greatest expertise. We need to periodically review our codes
to assure that they enable the deployment of the latest, useful,
building technologies. That has some benefit for construction costs and
even greater benefit for increasing the pace of new construction (or
rehabilitation). Second, is density. Lot size, allowable living unit
size, setbacks, building height, and other criteria are critical.
Density is also the most politically difficult to adjust. I participated
in the public opinion gathering for the Odana Plan and Greater East
Towne Plan, and I’m registered to participate in the West Area Plan that
particularly affects District 19. I’m very impressed with the efforts
that are being invested in these plans and the thoughtful consideration
for density and a range of housing choices. Third, is preserving
existing housing where possible. I like the provisions in the new TID51.
Fourth, is financing for affordable housing. At least for now,
technology is not going to give us really low-cost housing. We will need
to encourage every available financing tool from grants to TIF
districts.</p>
</div>
<div id="zoning-reform" class="section level2">
<h2>Zoning Reform:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: Municipalities across the country, including
Portland, Minneapolis, and Charlotte have taken steps to reform zoning
by eliminating parking minimums and allowing for small multi-family
buildings by-right throughout the city. Would you support similar
reforms in Madison? Why or why not? </strong></p>
<p>Revisiting parking minimums is a logical component of
transit-oriented-development. That’s where constraining the need for
vehicles and the attendant increase in developable space is balanced
with the availability of public transit. We are not going to have the
financing to provide frequent transit everywhere, and I am concerned
that constraining parking spaces in areas more remote from public
transit might increase vacancy in those areas, actually hurting our
supply of housing. I had a consulting arrangement in Portland in early
2022 involving the design of multi-family housing, owned and rental, and
the facilities to prefabricate major parts of the structures. We
evaluated whether ADU’s should be a priority, and concluded that
Portland’s uptake of the ADU zoning opportunity made that a low
priority. Madison is seeing a similar low uptake of the ADU opportunity.
The economics of small multi-family structures is challenging. Making
them optional everywhere may not yield as big an increase in housing as
a focused Increase in the zoning permissions for duplexes, 4-plexes,
vertical 3-flats, etc. in the most logical and politically achievable
locations.</p>

<h1>Madison Area Bus Advocates questions</h1>
<div id="general-vision" class="section level2">
<h2>General Vision:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: 2023 brings many significant changes for Metro
including the beginning of Bus Rapid Transit implementation, a complete
redesign of the transit network, and policy changes such as
Transportation Demand Management and Transit Oriented Development. Do
you support the current direction of Madison’s transit plans, and what
is your vision for Madison’s transit system in the mid and long term?
</strong></p>
<p>I have devoted time to studying all active area plans, TDM, TOD, the
2023 Metro route redesign, the first phase of BRT and future phases. I
believe they are conceptually strong, and may be the best designs
possible within the constraints of allocated funds and grants. Recent
public statements by candidates and activists about designing transit
around development rather than the reverse, seems to me a prescription
for inadequate and inequitable transit, maximized carbon emissions, and
even less affordable housing. There is at least a decade of hard work
before us just to realize the intent of these plans. Along the way there
will undoubtedly be some tweaks to keep the whole process moving toward
the desired goals. Unless the Wisconsin Legislature unexpectedly and
miraculously makes some changes in revenue-sharing formulae, we are
headed toward some very tough budget years that will heap further
challenges on staying the course. Vision and courage will be needed.</p>
</div>
<div id="sustainable-funding" class="section level2">
<h2>Sustainable Funding:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: In the Metro redesign, funding constraints limiting
the budget to 2019 levels required compromises in network coverage,
hours of service, and frequency outside a handful of core routes. What
would you do to establish more sustainable funding to improve Metro’s
quality of service? </strong></p>
<p>At this moment, it appears to me that in 2024 when the Common Council
develops the 2025 budgets, there will be no interim fix for the
structural deficit, and Madison will face some truly painful choices.
Searching for sustainable funding when myriad voices are justifying
holding on to some piece of their current funding will be stressful. I
hope my experience and skills in budgeting and finance will contribute
to the debate. In fact, I prefer that we start looking at choices and
alternatives now rather than in late 2024. I am impressed with the work
that your organizations have invested in analyzing transit systems. If
elected, I hope to draw on that expertise as we formulate a path
forward.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility" class="section level2">
<h2>Accessibility:</h2>
<p><strong>Question: The Metro network redesign has increased the
distance to the nearest bus stop for some residents. This is a major
concern for bus riders with limited mobility. What measures would you
take to ensure riders with mobility limitations are well-served by our
transit system? What do you think the role of paratransit is in this
regard? </strong></p>
<p>This is my ninth year on the Wexford Village Homes Association board,
and we have been active in educating our members on the impact of Metro
redesign. The majority of riders, like me, will walk to their same Route
15 and 68 stops on the new R1. Some will have to walk up to 4 blocks
further, and a few will have a shorter walk because of the new R2 route.
Transportation was very helpful this last month as I pulled together the
full impact of the change for our members. We can live with the redesign
in order to get the advantages of BRT and the redesign. Paratransit is
already a problem due funding and staffing challenges. We will need to
see how we can improve it.</p>
